    "External Solemnities": """
    Feasts are not transferred in the 1962 Missal unlike the Ordinary Form of the Roman Liturgy; it is obligatory to celebrate both the Mass and Divine Office on the traditional days. The “external solemnity” is a pastoral provision which may be made, but is not obligatory, in cases where a reasonable number of the faithful are unable to attend the feast on the day itself.

    There are only two feasts to which an external solemnity is automatically granted, those of the Sacred Heart and the Holy Rosary.
    """,

    "Fasting": """
    Complete abstinence is to be observed on all Fridays of the year, Ash Wednesday, the Vigils of Immaculate Conception and Christmas. Partial abstinence is to be observed on Ember Wednesdays and Saturdays and on the Vigil of Pentecost. Days of fast are all the weekdays of Lent, Ember Days, and the Vigil of Pentecost.

    If a vigil falls on a Sunday, the law of abstinence and fasting is dispensed that year and is not transferred to the preceding day. General custom allows a double portion of food at the collation on Christmas Eve (jejunium gaudiosum).

    On July 25, 1957, Pope Pius XII transferred the fast in the Universal Church from the Vigil of the Assumption to the Vigil of the Immaculate Conception on December 7, even though he had previously abrogated the Mass for the Vigil of the Immaculate Conception. Thus, this day starting in 1957 was a day of mandatory fasting and abstinence. This is preserved in the laws in force in 1962.

    "Feasts In Certain Locations": """
    The 1962 Missale Romanum contains a supplement of feasts approved for celebration in certain places; this incorporated changed mandated by Pope John XXIII regarding the suppresssion of some local feasts. Masses listed in this supplement may nowadays be said anywhere on days of the IV class. Some saints are also in the General Calendar; these saints have proper Masses in the supplement that may be said Ad Libitum in place of the Masses listed in the main body of the Missa.

    The rubrics stipulate that each diocese should have its own particular calendar, in which must be inscribed the following feasts: the feast of its principal Patron duly consecrated (1 cl.); the anniversary of Dedication of its Cathedral Church (1 cl.); and the feast of its secondary Patron duly consecrated (2 cl.). Certain feasts may have a higher rank or exist only in a particular country, diocese or congregation. Examples include the Dedication of a Cathedral or the Mass of a Patron Saint. These will appear as geographical data is added however they will not appear by default in the Universal Calendar.
    """,

    "Neo-Galacian Prefaces": """
    The "Neo-Galacian" prefaces are taken from 17th century French Altar Missals, though the texts themselves are far more ancient. They were, once, proper to France and have slowly become incorporated into the Roman Rite.

    Some are dead set against their use, however, in new editions of the 1962 Missale Romanum they are included. They are “ad libitum”, which means that the priest can choose whether to use them. The "Neo-Galacian" prefaces are shown by default in this app and the alternative is listed in the options for the days feast.
    """,

    "Votive Masses": """
    Votive Masses are always optional and are generally of the 4th class. They should not be offered on a liturgical day of the 1st or 2nd class. Votive Masses should not be offered on a liturgical day of the 3rd class unless there applies one of these exceptions:

    *First Thursday or First Saturday*
    A Votive Mass of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Supreme and Eternal Priest may be offered of the 3rd class where special exercises for the Sanctification of the Clergy are held.

    *First Friday*
    A Votive Mass of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus may be offered of the 3rd class where special exercises in honor of the Sacred Heart are held.

    *First Saturday*
    A Votive Mass of the Immaculate Heart of the Mary may be offered of the 3rd class where special exercises for the honor of the Immaculate Heart are held.

    During Advent, by indult in some regions or institutes, the Mass Roráte cœli désuper is a Votive Mass of the 3rd class.

    A Votive Mass may be offered on any day by indult.

    The Mass “Saturday of Our Lady” is not a Votive Mass. It is is proper to every Saturday which is not of the 1st, 2nd or 3rd class. On a Saturday when this Mass is proper, if a 4th class commemoration also falls on that date, the Priest may either offer the Mass “Saturday of Our Lady” and include that commemoration, or he may choose to offer the Mass from the Proper of Saints which corresponds to that commemoration.

    The “Daily Mass for the Dead” is of the 3rd class from November 3 through November 8, and on those dates it may be offered on any liturgical day of the 3rd or 4th class. On other days of the year, it is of the 4th class and can only be offered on 4th class ferias.
